# FVP

Family Vega Pacheco toolbox

This repository contains all the tools I use to manage my home. At the moment only inbounds and expenses. But the idea is to put everything here.

## How to run this?

You need Docker and Node installed locally.

Run the following command

```bash
npm run generate-certificate
npm run start
```
